# FaceID, on any system
First of all, you should run the "FaceTraining.py" file, you can change the 33 line, to what ever you want (the bigger, the better, but longer).
Then enter "1" and wait.

After that, you should go to the "FaceTraining_2.py", and just run it.

And the last part, is to run "main.py", (change the 32 line, to the terminal command, that will put your display to sleep on your system (on windows it is:
"%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0" i think...)).


That is it!
